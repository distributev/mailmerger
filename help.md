### Running a simple example

Run `org.distributev.mailmerger.MailMerger` with `examples` as the working directory with program arguments `-f planets.csv -c planets-configuration.xml`.

You should find 9 files generated inside the `outputfolder` folder.

*(TODO - Build a shaded/fat jar and add instructions for easily running/testing from the command line)*
